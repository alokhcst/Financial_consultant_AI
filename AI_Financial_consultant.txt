AI Financial consultant 

Functional Requirements:

Project Feature Requirements: AI Financial Consultant Platform
1. Intelligent Portfolio Construction

The platform must enable financial advisors to construct portfolios for clients in a smarter, easier way, reducing complexity and manual effort. 
It should integrate with conversational AI and “super agent” scenarios to streamline the advisor’s workflow. 

2. Investment Solution Discovery

Advisors need tools to find investment solutions using both structured data (performance, risk factors) and unstructured data (research materials, asset manager reports). 
The platform should aggregate and present this information efficiently, supporting advanced search and filtering capabilities. 

3. Portfolio Construction Workflow

The system must support the full workflow: asset allocation, tax impact analysis, transition planning, and risk analytics. 
It should provide tools for stress testing portfolios and evaluating value-add for clients. 

4. Flexible Client Reporting

Advisors require flexibility in reporting: some clients want detailed reports, others prefer executive summaries or one-pagers. 
The platform should allow customization of report formats and levels of detail. 

5. Super Agent Orchestration

The platform should orchestrate multiple agent capabilities: investment solution search, proposal generation, transition analysis, and sequencing of tasks. 
It must support account inception and consolidation workflows, automating the process from advice to account creation. 


Key Takeaways for Feature Development

Automation & AI Integration: The project must leverage AI to automate complex tasks and provide intelligent recommendations.
Data Aggregation: Both structured and unstructured data sources must be integrated for comprehensive investment analysis.
Workflow Support: End-to-end support for portfolio construction, including analytics and reporting, is essential.
Customization: Advisors need the ability to tailor outputs to client preferences.
Agent-Based Design: Modular “super agents” should handle distinct tasks and collaborate seamlessly.
